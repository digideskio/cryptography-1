# Ãœbung 8 - Chinese Remainder Theorem in practice

## Build Instructions
This exercise was implemented in C++ using the GMP library (version 6.0.0a). After adjusting the variable `CC` in the `Makefile` to your C++ compiler, a simple `make` should build and run the implementation.

## Implementation Details
Some of the algorithms are recursive. A conversion to iterative algorithms could possible result in even greater speed-ups.
### EEA.cc
Contains the simple and extended euclidean algorithm. The simple version is implemented iteratively, the extended recursively.

### CRT.cc
Contains the algorithms for the Chinese Remainder Theorem (recursive) and the exponentiation based upon it.

## Results
Run on my computer, the implementation produces the following results:
